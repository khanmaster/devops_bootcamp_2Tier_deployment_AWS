**Uploading data to our S3 bucket**

- Transfer/copy files to S3 using awscli from EC2/Ubuntu
```
aws s3 cp filename.yml s3://devops-content/
```
> Note: Replace the filename and bucketname
```
aws s3 cp debug_ec2_launch.yml s3://devops-content/
```
**Output**
```
upload: ./debug_ec2_launch.yml to s3://devops-content/debug_ec2_launch.yml
```
### Moving onto retrieving data from S3

- Download the file that we just uploaded to our S3 bucket devops-content
  - Command to download 
```
  aws s3 sync
 ```
- Retrieve our object from s3 bucket called devops-content and store it in downloads_s3 folder in our host machine
 ```
aws s3 sync s3://devops-content/ downloads_s3
```
Output:
```
download: s3://devops-content/debug_ec2_launch.yml to downloads_s3/debug_ec2_launch.yml
```
Verify:
 ```
  cd downloads_s3/ 
 ```

### How can we delete data from our bucket
- Let's delete single object from our bucket - in our case the file we uploaded earlier 
```
aws s3 rm s3://devops-content/debug_ec2_launch.yml
```
Output:
```
delete: s3://devops-content/debug_ec2_launch.yml
```
- Delete all content of S3
```
aws s3 rm s3://devops-content --recursive
```

**Time to clean up**

- Delete the S3 bucket we created
```
aws s3 rb s3://devops-content
```
- **```rb``` stands for remove bucket**
