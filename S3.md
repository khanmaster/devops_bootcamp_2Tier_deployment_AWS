## What is S3 bucket and use cases
**S3 is a Simple Storage Service provided by Amazon (AWS)**
- It is used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from around the globe on the web  
- We can also use it to host any static website on the cloud
- S3 provides robustness with simplicity and offers to:
-  ```Create buckets```
-   ```Store data on the cloud```
-   ```Download data from the cloud```
-    as well as make: 
-    ``` Data Persistent```
  
- We can use S3 on ```AWS UI``` and ```awscli``` from command line

**Let's move onto see some of these features in action**  
### Setting up awscli with required dependencies

- Python 3 or above is required
```
sudo apt-get install python
```
Install Python package pip
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip -y
```
Let's install ```AWSCLI``` now
```
sudo pip install awscli -y
```
- You may face an error of python version which you can override with below command
```
alias python=python3
```
Best practice is to create an ```env variable``` to make it persistent.

  **S3 Authentication setup with aws configure on EC2**
- Now we need to configure our EC2 machine with S3
```
  aws configure
```
You will be prompted to enter the aws access and secret keys
```
aws access keys xxxxxxx
aws secret keys xxxxxxx
```
Next:- insert the region name of your S3
```
eu-west-1
```
Default output format: Json is preferable
```
json
``` 
- We already have some buckets in that location
- Let's verify our configuration and check existing S3 buckets
```
aws s3 ls
```
We can see the list of buckets
```

**We have successfully setup S3 from our Machine!!!**

### Time to move onto utilising it's amazing benefits now

**Create S3 bucket from our machine using awscli**

- Couple of things we need to consider before creating our first bucket -
- **Naming convention** - **Region**
- Name ``` Eng-your-name-devops```
- Regions ``` eu-west-1```

- Let's run the command 
  ```
  aws s3 mb s3://devops-content --region us-west-1
  ```
  - **mb stands for make bucket**


**Uploading data to our S3 bucket**

- Transfer/copy files to S3 using awscli from EC2/Ubuntu
```
aws s3 cp filename.yml s3://devops-content/
```
> Note: Replace the filename and bucketname
```
aws s3 cp debug_ec2_launch.yml s3://devops-content/
```
**Output**
```
upload: ./debug_ec2_launch.yml to s3://devops-content/debug_ec2_launch.yml
```
### Moving onto retrieving data from S3

- Download the file that we just uploaded to our S3 bucket devops-content
  - Command to download 
```
  aws s3 sync
 ```
- Retrieve our object from s3 bucket called devops-content and store it in downloads_s3 folder in our host machine
 ```
aws s3 sync s3://devops-content/ downloads_s3
```
Output:
```
download: s3://devops-content/debug_ec2_launch.yml to downloads_s3/debug_ec2_launch.yml
```
Verify:
 ```
  cd downloads_s3/ 
 ```

### How can we delete data from our bucket
- Let's delete single object from our bucket - in our case the file we uploaded earlier 
```
aws s3 rm s3://devops-content/debug_ec2_launch.yml
```
Output:
```
delete: s3://devops-content/debug_ec2_launch.yml
```
- Delete all content of S3
```
aws s3 rm s3://devops-content --recursive
```

**Time to clean up**

- Delete the S3 bucket we created
```
aws s3 rb s3://devops-content
```
- **```rb``` stands for remove bucket**
